# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for classifying Parkinson's disease using machine learning. It utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the Parkinson's disease dataset from a CSV file.
2. Preprocesses and explores the dataset.
3. Calculates and visualizes the correlation between different attributes.
4. Trains an XGBoost classifier to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease.
5. Evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation.

## Dependencies
